# first-landing-page

This will be my first attempt at a landing page with little guidance after tutorials, I hope to get a deeper understanding of fleboxes. I'll perform HTML and CSS styles to make a landing page.

Update: I have added CSS style guide introduced flexbox layout and completed two sections of the layout. I also added free photos as placeholders for the layout. I have been cleaning up redundant areas that used too many divs and reduced the amount of times I used display: flexbox as well. 

Update 2: I completed the practice layout and got a better understanding of flexboxes and how to make containers to hold and position all of my content.
